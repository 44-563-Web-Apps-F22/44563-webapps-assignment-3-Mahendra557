        National Museum is a <strong>multidisciplinary</strong> which has collection from various regulations such as history, arts, etc. 
        I went there with three of my friends which accompanied me during the  tour. 
        Museums are very significant in terms of knowing the socio-cultural, religious and political history of one place.
        The National Museum in New Delhi is also known as <b>National Museum of India</b>.
