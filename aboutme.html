    <h2>LEGEND</h2>
    <p>
        The flashback episode where Balakrishna played the role of a middle-aged man was the only part that was watchable to some extent.
        Mainly Balakrishna intension is to help people against intruders. 
        Jagapathi Babu as villain is a relief, he did act well in his role.
        Balakrishna carries the fan following which his entire family has inherit over the years, 
        which allowed this film to be a so Call big hit in his career.
